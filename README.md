#What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
So for this problem we had to take a dataset and put it in a data structure so the data can be manipulated in where we can print the entire list of course sorted alphanumerically by its course number, and print a certain courses information along with prerequisities. To do this we had to have the code open a file parse through each line and store the information into course objects, then we had to create functions to search through our data strucuture for the information we were looking for.
#How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I think I still have a ways to go before I truly understand which data strucuture is the optimal one to use in different situations but this was a good learning experience in that I can still make something work but it might not be optimal. I think as I improve as a programmer I will learn how to really optimize not only my code but the way I approach problems.
#How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
At first with the project I originally wanted to use a hash table and spend a large amount of time trying to make it work but I realized that it would have been to time consuming to try and implement that so I decide to use vectors. It wasnt until after I finished that I realized a binary search tree would have been the optimal data strucute but I am still glad I was able to make my code function how I wanted.
#How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
It made me undernstand how to work with data strucutures better and when working on this particular project I tried to make code reusable by creating functions to be called later on in the code.
#How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I think I'm getting a better hang of object oriented programming, when I first learned that I didnt necessarily know how it was being implemented but now as Im writing code, I stop for a second and realize "wait maybe I should adjust this code so I can reuse parts of it later in the code"
